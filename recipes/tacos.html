    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      A taco is a traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand-sized
      corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is then
      folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a
      variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans,
      vegetables, and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety. They
      are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or
      sour cream, and vegetables, such as lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles.
      Tacos are a common form of antojitos, or Mexican street food, which have
      spread around the world.
